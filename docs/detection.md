# ExecFence Detection Model

This page is the technical companion to the main article. It explains what the scanner inspects and how the detection layers are intended to work.

ExecFence is built around execution surfaces. It prioritizes files and metadata that can cause code to run during:

- dependency install
- build
- test
- local dev
- IDE task execution
- CI
- packaging and publishing
- agent/MCP tool use

It is not a general-purpose code linter. The scanner is tuned for suspicious execution paths.

## What The Scanner Inspects

ExecFence inspects:

- JavaScript/TypeScript executable configs
- package scripts and lifecycle hooks
- npm/pnpm/yarn/bun lockfiles
- Cargo, Go, Poetry, and uv lockfiles
- GitHub Actions workflows
- `.vscode/tasks.json`
- Makefiles
- Tauri/Electron/VS Code extension surfaces
- committed executable and archive artifacts
- MCP and agent instruction/config files
- project-specific signatures in `.execfence/config/signatures.json`
- reviewed baseline exceptions in `.execfence/config/baseline.json`

It skips normal generated or dependency directories such as `.git`, `node_modules`, `dist`, `build`, `coverage`, `target`, caches, and test output by default.

## Rule Layers

### Exact IoC Matching

Known suspicious markers are detected as literal indicators. This is intentionally simple: exact matching is fast, deterministic, and explainable.

Use this layer for stable indicators such as known loader markers, suspicious endpoint strings, or campaign-specific strings that should never appear in normal project code.

### Regex Signatures

Regex rules catch families of suspicious code that do not have a single stable string.

Teams can add project-owned signatures in:

```text
.execfence/config/signatures.json
```

This keeps project-specific IoCs out of scanner source code and makes them reviewable with the rest of the project policy.

### Suspicious Loader Heuristics

ExecFence looks for JavaScript patterns that are unusual in normal config files but common in loader-style malware:

- global object assignment to dynamic Node module loading
- dynamic `Function` or constructor loaders
- `eval` combined with encoded or generated strings
- `fromCharCode` or base64-like decode paths used with dynamic execution
- `child_process` usage in executable project config
- very long obfuscated lines combined with loader markers

The scanner does not flag every minified file. It focuses on executable project surfaces where obfuscated loader behavior is higher risk.

### Lifecycle Script Audit

Package scripts are treated differently depending on whether they execute automatically. Install-time hooks such as `preinstall`, `install`, `postinstall`, and `prepare` are high-value attacker surfaces because package managers can run them during dependency installation or publication workflows.

ExecFence looks for risky behavior such as:

- shell downloads
- pipe-to-shell
- hidden PowerShell
- `curl` or `wget` execution chains
- eval-style execution
- suspicious binary launch paths
- install hooks in local packages/workspaces

### Lockfile Source Audit

Lockfiles are inspected for suspicious sources:

- raw GitHub URLs
- gist URLs
- paste hosts
- non-HTTPS package sources
- registry drift
- unexpected package source changes
- lifecycle/bin entries in newly introduced packages

The goal is not to replace dependency vulnerability scanning. It is to catch dependency source changes that may cause code execution during install/build/test.

### Executable And Archive Artifacts

ExecFence flags unexpected binaries and archives in source/build-input folders:

- `.exe`
- `.dll`
- `.bat`
- `.cmd`
- `.scr`
- `.vbs`
- `.wsf`
- `.zip`
- `.tar`
- `.tgz`
- `.asar`
- platform shared libraries and other executable-like artifacts

Reviewed artifacts should be pinned by SHA-256 through config or trust stores, with a reason and owner.

### Workflow Hardening

GitHub Actions workflows are audited for patterns that can turn untrusted repository code into credentialed execution:

- broad write permissions
- risky triggers
- unpinned actions
- pipe-to-shell
- publish workflows without provenance
- secrets exposed to untrusted PR contexts

### Agent And MCP Surface Audit

ExecFence treats agents as execution surfaces. MCP/tool manifests and agent instructions can expose powerful capabilities that are equivalent to local code execution.

The scanner and `agent-report` watch for:

- broad shell/process access
- broad filesystem access
- browser/network/credential access
- MCP configs added or changed in a diff
- agent instructions that tell tools to skip, disable, ignore, or bypass ExecFence/security checks

This is useful because agents can execute commands faster than a human can review each one.

## Baselines And Exceptions

Reviewed exceptions live in:

```text
.execfence/config/baseline.json
```

A good exception includes:

- `findingId`
- `file`
- `sha256`
- `reason`
- `owner`
- `expiresAt`

Use baselines for reviewed legacy findings. Do not baseline new `critical` or `high` findings only to make a build pass.

## Reports

Findings are written to timestamped JSON reports under:

```text
.execfence/reports/
```

Reports include severity, rule id, file, line, snippet, SHA-256, git evidence, remediation, local analysis, and runtime/sandbox evidence when available.

## Design Boundary

ExecFence is intentionally conservative about what it claims:

- It can block known suspicious patterns before execution.
- It can detect risky execution surfaces.
- It can preserve evidence when a command blocks.
- It can make agents prefer safer command execution.

It cannot prove arbitrary code is safe, replace EDR/AV, or provide hard sandbox isolation without platform/helper support.
